<p>
A Charity is an organisation that exists to enable one group of people to help another. 
Charity is done for the benefit, assistance, and relief of people in need. 
When carried out selflessly, it is a one-way act where an individual gives and asks for nothing in return. 
We forget that true happiness is beyond the definitions of owning and possessing and that 
it is the spiritual consciousness of defining various moments in our lives with love, grace, and gratitude.

<h1> ABOUT US </h1>
</div>
<p>
Sparks Charity benefits over 15,00,000 children and their families every year, through more than 400 live welfare projects on education, 
healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 2000 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.
Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the 
end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – 
and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen. Doubtless, education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. 
But child education cannot be done in isolation.  A child will go to school only if the family, particularly the mother, is assured of healthcare 
and empowered. Moreover, when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning, 
the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation.
